# LibraryAPI Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the LibraryAPI project! This project is a comprehensive library management system designed to help librarians, employees, and members manage library resources effectively. The project includes features such as book management, member management, loan management, and more. It is built with a focus on scalability, security, and ease of use.

## Project Overview
The LibraryAPI project is a RESTful API built using ASP.NET Core. It provides endpoints for managing library resources such as books, authors, categories, and members. The project also includes features for handling loans, calculating penalties, and managing user roles and authentication. The API is designed to be used by different roles such as librarians, employees, and members, each with specific permissions and capabilities.

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes a variety of technologies to ensure a robust and efficient system. Below is a detailed explanation of the key technologies used:

### ASP.NET Core
ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications. It is used to build the RESTful API that powers the LibraryAPI project.

### Entity Framework Core
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is an open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for .NET. It allows developers to work with a database using .NET objects, eliminating the need for most data-access code.

### Identity Framework
The ASP.NET Core Identity framework is used to manage users, passwords, roles, and claims. It provides a complete, customizable authentication and authorization system. It integrates seamlessly with EF Core to handle the storage and retrieval of user-related data.

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
JWT is used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is used for authentication and authorization in the LibraryAPI project.

### Docker
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. The LibraryAPI project is containerized using Docker to ensure consistency across different environments and ease of deployment.

### SQL Server
SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It is used as the database for the LibraryAPI project to store all the library data.

### Swagger
Swagger is an open-source tool for documenting APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore and test API endpoints. The LibraryAPI project includes Swagger for API documentation and testing.

## Docker Configuration

### Dockerfile
The Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image for the LibraryAPI project. It specifies the base image, copies the necessary files, restores dependencies, builds the project, and sets the entry point for the application.

### docker-compose.yml
The docker-compose.yml file is used to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It specifies the services, networks, and volumes needed to run the LibraryAPI project and the SQL Server database.

## Running the Dockerized Project

1. Pull the Docker Image:

```sh
docker pull mervanmunis/libraryapi
```

2. Run the Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

## Running the Non-Dockerized Version

To run the non-dockerized version of the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the non-dockerized branch:

```sh 
git clone -b non-dockerized https://github.com/yourusername/LibraryAPI.git
```

2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.

3. Update the connection string in appsettings.json to point to your local SQL Server instance.

4. Apply the migrations:

```sh 
dotnet ef migrations add Initial  
```

5. Apply the migrations:
```sh 
dotnet ef database update
```

## Conclusion

The LibraryAPI project provides a robust and scalable solution for managing library resources. With its comprehensive set of features, modern technology stack, and detailed documentation, it is well-suited for deployment in real-world library environments. The use of Docker ensures easy deployment and consistency across different environments.
