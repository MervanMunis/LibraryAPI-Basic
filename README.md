# LibraryAPI Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the LibraryAPI project! This project is a comprehensive library management system designed to help librarians, employees, and members manage library resources effectively. The project includes features such as book management, member management, loan management, and more. It is built with a focus on scalability, security, and ease of use.

## Project Overview
The LibraryAPI project is a RESTful API built using ASP.NET Core. It provides endpoints for managing library resources such as books, authors, categories, and members. The project also includes features for handling loans, calculating penalties, and managing user roles and authentication. The API is designed to be used by different roles such as librarians, employees, and members, each with specific permissions and capabilities.

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes a variety of technologies to ensure a robust and efficient system. Below is a detailed explanation of the key technologies used:

### ASP.NET Core
ASP.NET Core is a cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, internet-connected applications. It is used to build the RESTful API that powers the LibraryAPI project.

### Entity Framework Core
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is an open-source ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for .NET. It allows developers to work with a database using .NET objects, eliminating the need for most data-access code.

### Identity Framework
The ASP.NET Core Identity framework is used to manage users, passwords, roles, and claims. It provides a complete, customizable authentication and authorization system. It integrates seamlessly with EF Core to handle the storage and retrieval of user-related data.

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
JWT is used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is used for authentication and authorization in the LibraryAPI project.

### SQL Server
SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It is used as the database for the LibraryAPI project to store all the library data.

### Swagger
Swagger is an open-source tool for documenting APIs. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore and test API endpoints. The LibraryAPI project includes Swagger for API documentation and testing.

### Note: 
   * You can find the dockerized project from [LibraryAPI-Dockerized](https://github.com/MervanMunis/LibraryAPI-Dockerized.git)
